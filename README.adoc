= a5-1-rhdl
A rhdl implementation of the a5/1 stream cipher

NOTE: This doc is currently more of a unstructured diary of my progress than a proper documentation. I will try to clean it up later.

== Motivation

I used rusthdl before and it was quite nice. rusthdl development stopped and moved to its successor rhdl. However, rhdl is not quite finished yet, but should be usable. In this project I want to implement the a5/1 stream cipher in rhdl, to see how ready it is. I also want to document the process of using (and figuring out how to use) rhdl, so other people have it easier to get started.

== Setup

rhdl is currently not really documented, so we have to figure out how to install it.

First I created a new rust project using `cargo init`. Now I want to add the rhdl dependencies. They dont seem to be on crates.io, so I have to add them manually. I expect to need to make some changes to rhdl on the way, so I cloned the repo to my machine and added them as path dependencies. I am not yet sure which deps I need so I added all that are used by the https://github.com/samitbasu/rhdl/blob/main/rhdl/Cargo.toml[rhdl crate Cargo.toml]. I added the following to my `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
rhdl = { path = "../rhdl/rhdl" }
rhdl-core = { path = "../rhdlrhdl-core", features = ["iverilog"] }
rhdl-macro = { path = "../rhdl/rhdl-macro", version = "0.0.2" }
rhdl-std = { path = "../rhdl/rhdl-std" }
rhdl-fpga = { path = "../rhdl/rhdl-fpga" }
```

I am not sure what I should do next. I think I should first verify that rhdl works at all on my machine. I change into the rhdl repo and try to run `cargo test`. errros, that suggest icarus verilog is missing I think. I will add it to PATH and try again. Tests pass this time. *`iverilog` needs to be in the path for rhdl to work*. One test still fails, as it seems to require a `yosys` binary. I will install it and try again. I installed yosys, but the test still fails. However, the logs indicate, that it synthesizes but is missing some kind of file or something in the end. Ill ignore it for now.

I think the test that requires yosys probably contains a full example, as yosys is probably used quite late in the pipeline. So I take a look at that test (`test synchronous::get_blinker_synth`). Seems to be a full example, I will try to add it to my repo and get it to run here. Probably without the yosys part.

== TODO

- [ ] Figure out why the yosys test fails

== Existing documentation

I did not find any documentation besides the code itself. There are some mentions of rhdls differences to rusthdl.

- Under development since 2023
- Includes a co-compiler
- Compiler includes
- Type inference
- Type checking
- SSA transformation
- Lowering passes for ifs, loops, etc.
- Intermediate representation form
- VM to run the IR
- Generation of Verilog (other languages to be added)
- Automated detection of timing collisions, etc.
- Much more Rusty!
